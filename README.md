# ELIXIR-TrP-CodeRep-Example-R
The repository for developing the R scripts that are to be available to all the CodeRep courses and then modified to demonstrate that particular courses key concepts.     

The scripts are similar (but not identical) to the [Python version by Mark Fernandes](https://github.com/elixir-europe-training/ELIXIR-TrP-CodeRep-Example-Python). The scripts `plots.R` & `models.R` contain the functions required for implementing `wisconsin.R` (possibly headless) or generating deliverables from `wisconsin.Rmd`. Note that `wisconsin.R` is simply generated from `knitr::purl("wisconsin.Rmd", "wisconsin.R")`.
